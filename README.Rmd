The goal of `mocapr` is to help researchers and clinicians to work with motion capture data in R by providing functions that can import, plot, animate, and analyse motion capture data. The package is in **the early experimental stages of development**. 

`mocapr`, supports import from [the Captury](http://thecaptury.com/) system, but is capable of working with motion capture data from other systems as long as the data contain frame by frame global spatial joint-center positions. If the data contains these positions it is possible to wrangle the data into a format that will allow usage of the functions in this package. If you have such motion capture data from other systems,  I will be happy to make an attempt at writing an import function and include the function in future versions of this package. 


`mocapr` uses a series of tidyverse packages to import ([`readr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr), [`tidyr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr), [`dplyr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr), [`stringr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr), [`forcats`](https://github.com/tidyverse/forcats)), plot ([`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2), [`ggforce`](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/)), animate ([`gganimate`](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate)), and analyse motion capture data.  
The package also contains two sample data sets `mocapr_data` and `mocapr_synthetic_data` which is generated using some of the above packages as well as [`purrr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr).

While all functions should run without loading other libraries I recommend you also load the tidyverse `library(tidyverse)` when loading the mocapr library.

Feedback and suggestions for improvement and future developments are **most welcome**. 

## Short on the story behind the package
I am a Ph.d. student at The Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics, Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). My work is a part of the project Motor Skills in Pre-Schoolers ([MiPS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5576290/)), which is led by Lise Hestbæk.  
In MiPS we follow a cohort of \~950 pre-school children with yearly follow-ups. At each follow-up we collect data using markerless motion capture of the children as they perform a series of jumps and squats. My Ph.d. project revolves around collecting and analyzing this motion capture data, and the code available in this package is a more general form of some of the code I have written so far for use in this project. My initial attempts at approaching the data were made in Stata, but my work significantly picked up speed after I was introduced to R in the summer of 2017, and especially after I discovered the Tidyverse.

I have found R to be completely capable of working with large amounts of motion capture data, and I hope this package can, at least, serve as an inspiration as to how R can be utilized to work with motion capture data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `mocapr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("steenharsted/mocapr")

### The built in datasets
`mocapr` contains two sample data sets `mocapr_data` and `mocapr_synthetic_data`  

#### mocapr_data
`mocapr_data` consists of `r length(unique(mocapr::mocapr_data$movement_nr))` movements, each supplied with a number (`movement_nr`) and a short description (`movement_description`). Videos of the movements with an overlay of the track is available at this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMjrjny4Ymmd1nSGHU0A6dWfEWjBxc-VQ). The videos are made using the CapturyLive software.

The data is also available as raw exports in .csv format, and can be found in the folder "data-raw".

Lets load `mocapr` and inspect the `mocapr_data`:  
```{r load_packages_show_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(mocapr)

#Data
mocapr_data %>% 
  group_by(movement_nr, movement_description) %>% 
  nest()
```

The format of the data is wide and contains frame by frame joint angles and global joint center positions. Therefore, each joint is typically represented by 6 columns (3 angles and 3 positions). To prevent long repetitive column names, all joint related variables are abbreviated according to their side (L|R), joint(A|K|H|S|E|W), and angle|position.    

| Side    | Joint        |Angle/Position |
| :---    | :---         | :---          |    
|         | A  (Ankle)   |F  (Flexion)   |
|L (left) | K  (Knee)    |Varus          |
|         | H  (Hip)     |DF (Dorsi Flexion)|
|R (Right)| W  (Wrist)   |X  (joint center position on the global X axis (floor)|
|         | E  (Elbow)   |Y  (joint center position on the global Y axis)(up)|
|         | S  (Shoulder)|Z  (joint center position on the global Z axis)(floor)|


Example for left knee:

| Abbreviated Variable Name | Meaning of abbreviation |
| :---:        |     :---:      | 
|LKF | Left Knee Flexion | 
|LKX | Left Knee joint center position on the X axis (floor plane) | 


The focus of this tutorial is on plotting and animating motion capture data. For this we only need the joint center positions. I will not discuss the joint angles further, but feel free to explore them on your own.

#### `mocapr_synthetic_data`
Is artificial data generated via a script. It only contains spatial joint-center positions in the anatomical planes. `mocapr_synthetic_data` is intended to display how the frontal plane kinematics work, and also to display sitations where they are likely to fail due to planar cross-talk.


## Animating Motion Capture Data With `mocapr`
Lets first create some sample data:
```{r create_data}
jump_1 <- filter(mocapr::mocapr_data, movement_nr == 2)

jump_2 <- filter(mocapr::mocapr_data, movement_nr == 3)

gait <-  filter(mocapr::mocapr_data, movement_nr == 6)

capoeira <- filter(mocapr::mocapr_data, movement_nr == 9)
```

### Animating with `animate_global()`
The global coordinate system refers to a 3D coordinate system (X, Y, and Z axis) that is created and oriented during the setup and calibration of many motion capture systems. Global joint center positions refer to the position of a given joint center inside the global coordinate system.  
The `animate_global()` function animates the subject using the global joint center positions. It creates two animations: one in the X and Y plane; and one in the Z and Y plane. If the subject is moving along either the X or the Z axis the viewpoints will essentially be a side view and a front|back view.  
```{r jump_1_GP}
jump_1 %>% 
  animate_global(
    
    # gganimate options passed via ...
    nframes = nrow(.), 
    fps = 50)
```

If the recorded subject moves at an angle to the axis' of the global coordinate system, animations and plots using global joint center positions will have oblique viewpoints. `jump_2` contains a simulated poor landing on the right knee, but the direction of the movement occurs at an oblique angle to the X and Z axis' in the global coordinate system. Therefore, using the `animate_global()` function on `jump_2` produces an animation with oblique viewpoints.
```{r jump_2_GP}
jump_2 %>% 
  animate_global(
    
    # gganimate options passed via ...
    nframes = nrow(.), 
    fps = 50)
```

### Animating with `animate_movement()` and `animate_anatomical()`
In many cases, out of axis movement and oblique viewpoints are easy to prevent. In these cases the `animate_global()` function might be sufficient, but in other cases, such as working with with pre-school children, out of axis movement is difficult to prevent without interfering with the spontaneous movements of the subject. Oblique viewpoints may also stem from differences in the orientation of the global coordinate system between motion capture systems or between different setups of the same motion-capture system.
  
For the purpose of analyzing or interpreting motions, oblique viewpoints are, in general, less optimal. This creates a need for animation and plotting functions that are free from the orientation of the global coordinate system, and instead focused on either the subject itself or the direction of the movement the subject is performing.
`mocapr` solves this challenge by providing two functions that projects the global joint center positions onto the planes of the movement direction (`project_full_body_to_MP()`) or the anatomical planes the subject (`project_full_body_to_AP()`). You can think of these functions as functions that creates new coordinate systems that are just **shifted/tilted** version of the global coordinate system, such that animations that use the joint center positions in the new coordinate systems will have viewpoints that are directly in front of and to the side of the direction of the movement (`animate_movement()`) or the person (`animate_anatomical()`).

The direction of the movement is determined by the position of the subject at the first and the last frame of the recording.

These functions are best explained by looking at animations.

Lets look again at `jump_2` (the jump that is oblique to the global coordinate system), and animate the jump using the `animate_movement()` and the `animate_anatomical()` functions.
```{r jump_2_MP}
jump_2 %>%
  
  # Project to the movements planes
  project_full_body_to_MP() %>%
  
  # Animate the movement plane projections
  animate_movement(
    
    # gganimate options passed via ...
    nframes = nrow(.),
    fps = 50, rewind = FALSE
    )
```

```{r jump_2_AP}
jump_2 %>% 
  #Project to the anatomical Planes 
  project_full_body_to_AP() %>% 
  
  #Animate the anatomical projections
  animate_anatomical(
    #gganimate options passed via ...
    nframes = nrow(.), 
    fps = 50)
```

*note: the right side appears on the right side in the anatomical animation and on the left side in the movement animation, this is intentional but might change in future versions*. 

Besides the size difference the two animations are very similar. This is because the movement that the subject is performing is uni-directional. For movements where the subject is moving in one direction with limited rotation of the pelvis (such as walking in a straight line, or jumping using both legs) the two projections and the following animations will produce similar results, but the results will differ greatly if the direction of the movement changes throughout the recording.   
 
Lets explore the difference between the two types of projections by looking at a movement that is not unidirectional.  

#### animate_movement()  
```{r walking_square_MP}
gait %>%
  
  # Project to the movements planes
  project_full_body_to_MP() %>%
  
  # Animate the movement plane projections
  animate_movement(
    
    # gganimate options passed via ...
    nframes = nrow(.), 
    fps = 50
    )
```

#### animate_anatomical()  
```{r walking_square_AP}
gait %>%
  
  # Project to the anatomical Planes 
  project_full_body_to_AP() %>%
  
  # Animate the anatomical projections
  animate_anatomical(
    
    # gganimate options passed via ...
    nframes = nrow(.),
    fps = 50
    )
```

Now the difference between the two types of animations is evident. `animate_movement()` gives you *fixed viewpoints* (you are standing still and watching the movement) and `animate_anatomical()` *updates your viewpoint for each frame* (you are always watching the subject from the back and the side of the pelvis).


## using `mocapr` to plot
The three animate functions can be used to plot if you supply the argument `return_plot = TRUE`. I suggest you reduce the number of frames before you use the functions to plot.

```{r show_how_to_plot}
jump_2 %>%
  
  # Project to the anatomical Planes
  project_full_body_to_AP() %>% 
  
  # Reduce the number of frames in the data
  filter(frame %in% c(100, 120, 140, 150, 170, 180)) %>% 
  
  # Animate the anatomical projections
  animate_anatomical(planes = c("F"),
                     use_geom_point = FALSE, 
                     planes_in_rows_or_cols = c("cols"), 
                     col_facets = frame,
                     return_plot = TRUE)
```

## Animating and plotting multible movements
`mocapr` utilizes the powerful faceting features of `ggplot2`. This means that you can plot and animate mulitple movements next to eachother. This is especially usefull if you wish to visualize variation in movement patterns (test-retest or pre-post treatment scenarios).

When you animate multiple movements the movements will only rarely have the same duration. `mocapr` allows you to align such movements based on a key event via the function `align_movements()`

The below example aligns and animates two standing broad jumps. The jumps are aligned on the frame containing the impact frame.

```{r show_align_movments}
mocapr_data %>% 
  filter(movement_nr %in% c(1,2)) %>% 
  
  align_movements(
    .group_var = movement_nr,  # The column that contains the grouping
    event_var = marks, # The column that contains the key event
    event_value = "FFB",  # The value specifying the key event in the event_var column
    prolong_event = 25  #  Nr. of frames you would like to "freeze" the key event
    ) %>% 
  
  
  animate_global(
    row_facets = movement_nr,
    
    # gganimate options passed via ...
    nframes = nrow(.),
    fps = 50)
```


When plotting, it is less of an issue if the recordings are of differing duration, but you need to select the frames of importance in some other way.

The below example takes two jumps, divide the jumps into phases using the `add_jump_events()` function and then filters individual frames based on the phases.

```{r}
mocapr_data %>% 
  
  # Take two jumps
  filter(movement_nr %in% c(1,3)) %>% 
  group_by(movement_nr) %>% 
  
  # Add jump phases and events
  group_modify(~add_jump_events(.x)) %>% 
  group_modify(~project_full_body_to_AP(.x)) %>%
  
  # Keep only single frame events and highest position in jump
  filter(
    phase %in% c(2, 4, 6, 8) | CGY == max(CGY)) %>% 
  
  animate_anatomical(
    planes = "F",             # Show only the forward plane, change to "R for the forward plane. Remove for both planes
    row_facets = movement_nr, # Facet the two movements in two rows
    col_facets = phase,       # Facet the phases in columns
    return_plot = TRUE,       # Return a plot

    # Just styling options
    use_geom_point = FALSE,
    line_colored_size = 1.2,
    line_black_size = 1,
    line_black_alpha = 1)
```



## Adjust the speed of the animation
I find slow-mo effects is best achieved by adding more rows, e.g., `nrow(.)*2`
```{r show_options, fig.asp=0.5, fig.width=10}
capoeira %>% 
  filter(frame > 48 & frame < 223) %>% 
  project_full_body_to_MP() %>% 
  animate_movement(
    
    #gganimate options passed via ...
    nframes = nrow(.)*2, 
    fps = 50)
```
